# Cross-platform

The Landscape Metaverse is being developed for various devices, which means that you can access it with desktop and mobile devices in addition to virtual reality glasses, but you will not have the 3D feature.

The cross-platform feature is being developed so that even users who cannot afford virtual reality glasses can log in to the Metaverse with other devices on the web or native applications and start playing and earning money . More details will be available on this page soon so you can find ways to fit your favorite device into The Landscape Metaverse.
