### Amirali - CEO & Founder

Before I came up with the idea for The Landscape Metaverse project, I had a lot of experience in   programming and worked as a senior developer, consultant, product manager in the field of technology. I am a fan of web3 and the world of Metaverse and I can boldly say that I have a good background in this field. I have now devoted myself entirely to The Landscape Metaverse project, and I am confident that my day-to-day efforts in advancing this project will not be ineffective.
