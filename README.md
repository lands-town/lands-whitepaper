## The Landscape

The Landscape project is building a cross-platform Metaverse in the Polygan blockchain. The goal of The Landscape project is to imagine yourself in a modern, unrestricted and decentralized world&#x20;

You can walk in The Landscape Metaverse, make new friends, go to different events with them, such as concerts, auctions, etc., invite each other for a cup of coffee, and many other things that we do not specify as the avatars themselves decide whether to play to earn or just enjoy existing within a limitless universe.&#x20;

The Landscape is not just a game, it can be called a new lifestyle that makes use of free-to-play and play-to-earn potential as well as attractive blockchain features such as non-exchangeable tokens (NFT) and decentralized finance (DEFI).
