# Decentralized exchanges

Imagine you are walking with your avatar in The Landscape Metaverse and you see ATM-like machines all over the city. You may say to yourself that these machines are ATMs, but this is not the case. In fact, these are DEX machines.You can use these machines to buy , sell and exchange the cryptocurrency in your wallet.

Since you are in The Landscape Metaverse, it means that you have authenticated with your wallet, so you no longer need to log in again with your wallet to use the DEX machines services.

There is another way to buy and sell and exchange cryptocurrency in The Landscape Metaverse, and that is to use your smartwatch, which means you no longer even need to go to the nearest DEX machine with your avatar. Wherever you are in The Landscape Metaverse, you can start trading.
