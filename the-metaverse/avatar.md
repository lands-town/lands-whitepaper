# Avatar

After registering and entering The Landscape Metaverse, you will be given an avatar with random and unique appearance features. You can walk around The Landscape Metaverse using your avatar and take part in various activities.

Avatars are in NFT format, so you cannot transfer it to another person (its smart contract also does not have the transfer function). Each wallet address can only have one avatar, if you want to have multiple avatars, you must login to The Landscape Metaverse using different wallets, consider that this is not against the rules of The Landscape, but we do not recommend you to do this.

### Unique avatars

The appearance of each avatar is different from the other avatars. These differences may be very small or large. In any case, you can provide clothes and tools for that avatar to stand out.
