# Lending system

The loan system in The Landscape Metaverse is fully operated by DEFI method, there are no intermediaries, everything is done without the need to verify your true identity. The Landscape Metaverse loan system is fully automated and implemented by a smart contract, and no person or entity is involved or will be involved.

Thanks to Decentralized Finance Potential (DEFI) which is going to be used in The Landscape Metaverse project, there is no need to wait for weeks for an initial loan approval, guarantor, pay slip, etc. (The same loan system used in most countries today in the world)

In this system, you can receive $ LANDS tokens from 50 to 75% of the value of your land with a 15 to 25 percent interest rate and pay it in installments until your land is returned to your wallet. Everything is done as it should be as long as there is no interference in its repayment. If you can not afford it, your land will be auctioned off.
