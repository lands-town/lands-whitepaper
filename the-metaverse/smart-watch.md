# Smartwatch

After first entering The Landscape Metaverse, a smartwatch will be given to your avatar, these smartwatches have many uses and functions other than showing the time. Some of these uses are mentioned here but notice that these smartwatches have many more functions.

* Buying tickets (Movies, concerts and etc...).
* Making reservations (Coffee shops , restaurants and etc..).
* Quick access to NFTmarketplace.
* Quick access to your wallet.
* Cryptocurrency exchange with The Landscape's decentralized exchange.
* Requesting services.
* Applying for interest-free loan.
* Chatting with your friends.
* Checking the online status of your friends in The Landscape Metaverse.
* And...

It can be said that these smartwatches are the same as the avatar dashboard in The Landscape Metaverse environment. You can not transfer your smartwatch to another account, these watches are unique and only the owner (the same avatar) can use them. The smartwatch that is initially given to avatars has limited features. To improve the performance and features of your smartwatch, you can buy more modern and better watches from the market (NFT Marketplace). Soon, the list of smartwatch categories with their features and performance will be uploaded on this page.
