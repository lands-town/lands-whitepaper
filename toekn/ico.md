# ICO

ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is a method of securing the initial capital of the project in which the tokens are sold before the start of the project (usually at a lower price and cheaper) and people can participate in the project by buying tokens.

If The Landscape Metaverse project succeeds, the value of the tokens you bought at the ICO for less than the actual value will be multiplied.&#x20;

> We are confident in the success of the project even if the required capital is not raised in the first ICO. The next stage of ICO tokens starts with better marketing`(0.5M-1M-4M)`

### Advantages&#x20;

In this ICO, not only you'll buy tokens at a lower price (less than the real value), but also The Landscape itself gives a number of features to the participants in addition to the tokens to the participants. These features are not usually found in the ICOs of other projects

* Buyers who purchase more than 15,000 LANDS tokens will receive an NFT land as a gift from The Landscape. (NFTs will be sent to your wallet at the same address as you participated in ICO on the Polygon Mainnet.)
* You can return tokens purchased at the ICO up to 3 days before the end of the ICO at the same price you purchased and return on your original investment, or only return a number of your tokens(this feature is not usually seen in other ICOs we have added this feature to build more trust in The Landscape Project ICO so that you can return your tokens immediately if you cancel your purchase and not wait for pricing in other exchanges).

### Soft cap and Hard cap

#### -Soft cap - 8,000,000 $LANDS

Soft cap is the minimum capital required to start a project. In the ICO of The Landscape Project the soft cap is worth 8 million Landscape tokens, and if the tokens purchased by the participants reach this total, the project will start to work.

> Before the soft cap, there are a few targets or steps so that if we do not reach the required capital in the first ICO, targets are used for marketing and introduction of more projects to receive more capital(thus you cannot sell your tokens until the next ICO or token pricing).

#### -Hard cap - 24,000,000 $LANDS

Hard cap is the maximum capital required to start a project. Note this amount may vary.
